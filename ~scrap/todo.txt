BAD CSS IDS AND CLASSES
  js-footerSelect   -> js-footer
  pId               -> post-id
  
X Make Load More button retrieve completed HTML from back-end.
X access Heroku database and remove leading/trailing whitespace from tag names, and other bad things
X Center modals vertically via javascript.
X Add Mustafa's linkedin to about page  https://www.linkedin.com/in/mustafa-ahmed-6a8210104
  _ for "team" branch, too
X Javascript a maximum width on hamburger dropdown = $('#global-nav').width() - $('#brand').width()
• choice-under-chat
  X Rename #take-sides-column to #debate-info-section
  X Move controls for choosing side, entering the queue, etc. to chat box area; chat box only appears when user is allowed to use it
  X debate-info-section compacts at "tiny" breakpoint to display above chat message scroll
    X "Subject" heading display: none when compact
    ? (partially?) replaces navbar
      ! would be easier to implement if every page didn't load every stylesheet
  • Add to debate-info-section:
    • current champion for each side
      X Full-size
      _ Compact: Green box on left side and red box on right side of chat message scroll, containing champ name and thumb up/down icon
    • live-updating number of agree/disagree (need new socket broadcast)
      _ Full-size: under subject box
      _ Compact: between current champion for each side, with thumb icons(?) instead of words
        ? thumb icons already next to champ names, so maybe some other icon to indicate how many in the "choir"
_ modal confirmation to salute or boot
_ disable mCustomScrollbar on touch devices
  ? or make custom scroll bar draggers always visible on touch devices
_ Move login form into shared template and display in choice area when user not logged in
_ Socket.IO broadcast after upvote/downvote persisted
  • Probably require sending and receiving votes through socket instead of AJAX
_ convert most px units to em
  • news column
  • ...
? only link stylesheets on the pages where they apply
? show buttons for "Stop Arguing" and more(?) in thin column on right of chatbox
_ Use "fq" instead of "q" and http://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html to make initial news search OR tag names together for more results
_ Change all use of "Post" in user-visible text to "Debate"
_ Move inline styles in about.ejs into stylesheet
? Switch out jQuery fadeIn/fadeOut calls for CSS opacity transitions?
? printer-friendly CSS for debate pages?
_ show each champion's "confidence" rating with the audience, with "salute" (upvote) and "boot" (downvote) buttons next to the rating for your own side's champion
  ? low confidence should theoretically lead to losing your champion spot, somehow
? inactivity timer to boot idle champions
